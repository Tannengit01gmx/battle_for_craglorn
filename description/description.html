<b>The map "Battle for Craglorn" is a fantasy setup.</b>
<br><br>
Mithril has been found in the barren wastes of Craglorn. Soon the word of endless riches is spread across the continent. Orc Tribes from the eastern wastes move in to claim their right on the new-found treasure. Not long and the Emperor of men himself sends a huge army into the barren country. At the same time sturdy dwarves climb down from the northern mountains to claim what is theirs by birthright. But the dwarven Kingdom is not all alone in the north. Hordes of Ratmen follow the call of their Ratgod to conquer the Mithril Mines. The battle for Craglorn has begun.
